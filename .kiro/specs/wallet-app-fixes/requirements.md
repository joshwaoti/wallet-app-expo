# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the wallet app issues that arose after adding new features (accounts, budgets, statistics, settings). The app currently has errors and is not running properly due to configuration mismatches, database schema issues, and dependency conflicts between the original and modified versions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile app to connect to the correct backend API, so that all features work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app starts THEN it SHALL use the correct API URL from environment variables
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL point to the running backend server
3. IF the API URL is not configured THEN the app SHALL display a clear error message

### Requirement 2: Database Schema Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want all app features to work without database errors, so that I can manage my finances effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL create all required database tables (users, accounts, budgets, transactions)
2. WHEN existing transactions exist THEN they SHALL be migrated to work with the new schema
3. WHEN foreign key constraints are added THEN existing data SHALL remain intact
4. IF database migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Navigation Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between all app screens smoothly, so that I can access all features without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL display the tab navigation with all screens
2. WHEN I tap on any tab THEN it SHALL navigate to the correct screen
3. WHEN I navigate to add-account screen THEN it SHALL work from both accounts tab and direct navigation
4. IF navigation fails THEN the app SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4: API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all CRUD operations to work properly, so that I can manage accounts, budgets, and view statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an account THEN it SHALL be saved to the database and appear in the accounts list
2. WHEN I create a budget THEN it SHALL track my spending against the budget amount
3. WHEN I view statistics THEN it SHALL display accurate data from my transactions
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the app SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5: Data Migration

**User Story:** As a user with existing transaction data, I want my data to remain accessible after the app updates, so that I don't lose my financial history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN existing transactions SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN accounts are introduced THEN existing transactions SHALL be assigned to a default account
3. WHEN users table is created THEN existing user data SHALL be preserved
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 6: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the app SHALL display specific error messages
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the app SHALL highlight the problematic fields
4. WHEN the app crashes THEN it SHALL log errors for debugging purposes
